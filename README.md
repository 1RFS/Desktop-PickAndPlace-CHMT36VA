![SparkFun Low Cost Desktop Pick and Place Machine](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Setup-1.jpg)

The CHMT36VA is a $2800 desktop sized pick and place machine from Charm High. We use it to produce a variety of designs, 50 to 100pcs at a shot. It works very well for low-volume high-mix pick and place of 0603 based designs.
